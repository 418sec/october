The ```octobercms``` had a Username Enumeration vulnerability. Username enumeration is possible at the login page of octobercms login page. This was due to the error message it showed while giving wrong credentials.
However the login was in the repo (https://github.com/octobercms/october), but the error message was in a completely different repo (https://github.com/octobercms/library). 
While installing ```octobercms``` from the ```install master``` all the repos in the octobercms (https://github.com/octobercms) is combined to form the entire ```octobercms``` system. That is why the error message was not available in the october repo. 
Please find the fix in the ```username-enum-fix``` branch of my fork of the repository. (https://github.com/d3m0n-r00t/library/blob/username-enum-fix/src/Auth/Manager.php)
